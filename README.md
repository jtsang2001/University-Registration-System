# ESOF3050_Project

## Overview
The objective of this project is to design & develop a University Registration System (URS) along with its database to manage student enrollment in classes, university employee roster, and previous course history in addition to many other features for the university, depending on the role of the user. The database would provide different permissions and functions depending on the userâ€™s type of account, consisting of either students, instructors, or administrators. The problem with today's current registration and database systems is that they are not user friendly enough for university students and staff. We are seeking to create the easiest and least stressful experience possible for new and existing students as well as administrators, instructors and any other staff members that may be using the system.
